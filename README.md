# MassXSS - Web Vulnerability Scanner
MassXSS is a simple yet effective web vulnerability scanner designed to detect Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in web applications. The tool is developed in Python3 and utilizes various payloads to identify different types of XSS vulnerabilities, including Reflected XSS, Stored XSS, XSS via Event Handlers, and HTML Filter Bypass.

Features:

    Reflected XSS Detection: Identifies vulnerabilities where user input is immediately reflected in the response.
    Stored XSS Detection: Scans for vulnerabilities where malicious scripts are stored and executed upon retrieval.
    XSS Event Handler Detection: Detects XSS vulnerabilities triggered through event handlers.
    HTML Filter Bypass Detection: Identifies XSS vulnerabilities with payloads that can bypass HTML filters.
